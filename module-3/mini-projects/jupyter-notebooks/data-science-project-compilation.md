# 📊 Data Science Project Compilation

This compilation of projects is designed to enhance your skills in **data analysis**, **data preparation**, and **data visualization** using Python’s popular libraries:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

Students are expected to complete **three mini-projects**, each focusing on a different aspect of data science.

---

## 📈 Project 1: Data Analysis with NumPy

**🎯 Objective:**  
Utilize **NumPy** to perform statistical analysis on a dataset.

**📝 Task:**  
- Load a dataset (e.g., weather data or stock prices)
- Calculate:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Standard deviation
  - Correlation between columns

**📦 Deliverable:**  
A **Jupyter Notebook** that includes:
- Clear commentary on each step
- Visualizations and outputs from NumPy operations

---

## 🧹 Project 2: Cleaning and Preparing Data with Pandas

**🎯 Objective:**  
Demonstrate data cleaning and preparation skills using **Pandas**.

**📝 Task:**  
- Choose a raw dataset (from **Kaggle**, a **public API**, etc.)
- Perform cleaning operations:
  - Handle missing values
  - Filter or reshape data
  - Convert data types

**📦 Deliverable:**  
A **Jupyter Notebook** with:
- A walkthrough of the cleaning process
- Comments explaining the rationale for each operation

---

## 📊 Project 3: Comprehensive Data Visualization

**🎯 Objective:**  
Showcase data visualization techniques using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

**📝 Task:**  
- Create visualizations including:
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Line charts
  - Heatmaps
- Highlight different insights from the dataset

**📦 Deliverable:**  
A **Jupyter Notebook** featuring:
- A gallery of well-labeled plots
- Descriptions of the insights each plot provides

## 🌐 Displaying Your Projects

After completing the mini-projects, you will **showcase your work online** using platforms such as:

### 🔗 Binder
- Run your notebooks **interactively** via a shareable link
- [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/)

### 📘 NBViewer
- Provide a **static view** of your notebooks
- [https://nbviewer.org/](https://nbviewer.org/)

> 🧠 You're encouraged to explore both options and choose the one that best suits your project’s presentation. Assistance will be provided to help you set up and deploy your notebooks.
